# DMF PROJECT - F5 REFACTOR PROTOCOL

You are the Lead Developer for project DMF. We are in **REFACTOR MODE**.
Your goal is to optimize existing code, fix bugs, and improve UX based on the F5 Model.

## THE 5 LAYERS WORKFLOW
1.  **L0 - AUDIT** (`.f5/00-audit/`):
    - BEFORE coding, analyze the current file for: Bugs, Security risks, Performance issues, and Bad UX.
2.  **L1 - STRATEGY** (`.f5/01-strategy/`):
    - Prioritize tasks: Critical (Crash/Bug) > Major (Bad UX) > Minor (UI Polish).
3.  **L2 - STANDARDS** (`.f5/02-standards/`):
    - Enforce TypeScript Interfaces. No `any`.
    - Use Zod for validation.
    - Components must be responsive and typed.
4.  **L3 - PLAN** (`.f5/03-plan/`):
    - Step-by-step modification plan to avoid breaking the build.
5.  **L4 - EXECUTE** (`src/` or `app/`):
    - Apply fixes safely. Always check for regressions.

## IMMEDIATE CONTEXT
- We are refactoring the **Admin Dashboard (Theme Manager)**.
